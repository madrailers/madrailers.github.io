# MadRailers Meetup

MadRailers is a <a href="http://meetup.com/mad-railers">Meetup group</a> that was founded in 2010
to provide an organization for rubyists in Madison, Wisconsin.

We hold monthly meetups that typically involve **one hour of Office Hours**, where experienced
Ruby and Rails developers are available **to help out new folks**, and **one hour of Presentations**,
where every month a different speaker does **speaks for 30-60 minutes on a Ruby or Rails topic**.

Check out a <a href="schedule.html">list of our upcoming meetups</a>, or
<a href="presentations.html">watch some videos</a> of recent presentations. We also have a
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mad-railers">Google Group</a> that's available
for questions.

If you're interested in Sponsoring or Speaking at a MadRailers Meetup, please contact
**Zachery Moneypenny** (@whazzmaster on Twitter). We can work with you to define a topic and date
that works for you!
